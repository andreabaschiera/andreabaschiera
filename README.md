## Hi there 👋

I am specialised in policy analysis and climate socio-economic modelling, and I have practical experience in data analysis, simulation and scripting. I work primarily with R, Python to build reproducible analyses, run models and automate workflows.

- 🔭 Main languages: R, Python, VBA
- 🧰 Tools: Git, tidyverse, ggplot2, RMarkdown/Quarto, Shiny, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, LaTeX

Portfolio
---------

Below are selected university projects (exams / assignments) and work-related code. University entries include a report (PDF) and the analysis code/notebook; work entries link to the repository.

University projects (exam reports + code)
- Project title — short one-line description  
  - PDF (report): [Exam_AB_final.pdf](/path/to/report.pdf)  
  - Code: [link to code](/path/to/code) — R / Python / VBA
- Project title — short one-line description  
  - PDF (report): [link to PDF](/path/to/report2.pdf)  
  - Code: [link to code](/path/to/code2)
- (Add more entries following the same pattern: report PDF + code)

Work repositories (selected code from previous positions)
- Repository name — brief description — https://github.com/ORG/REPO-1
- Repository name — brief description — https://github.com/ORG/REPO-2

How to navigate the portfolio
- Replace each placeholder link above with the actual file/repo URL.
- For university projects, I prefer to provide both the final PDF (exam/assignment submission) and the full analysis code (R scripts, Python notebooks or zipped folder).
- For work projects, I link to the repository only (sensitive or proprietary parts removed where necessary).
